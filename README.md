For text classification.

From **Introduction to Information Retrieval** by _Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan & Hinrich Sch√ºtze_, [Text classification and Naive Bayes](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/text-classification-and-naive-bayes-1.html):

"general classes are usually referred to as _topics_, and the classification task is then called _text classification_, _text categorization_, _topic classification_, or _topic spotting_"
